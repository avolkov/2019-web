.. NOTES (THIS IS A COMMENT)
   You can think of the following as a function call with named arguments. The
   mandatory arguments are,
   * name
   * pycon_title
   * photo
   * description
   We have a few optional ones (to put links at the bottom of your profile),
   * twitter_url
   * github_url
   * instagram_url
   * bitbucket_url
   * gitlab_url
   * mastodon_url
   * linkedin_url
   * personal_url
   If you want another optional URL with a fancy icon, just select an icon from
   https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/  and ping @abraham on the #website on
   our slack.
